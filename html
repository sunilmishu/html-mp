    <p>Hanuman Chalisa is a devotional hymn in Awadhi language (a language similar to Hindi and whose origin is from Sanskrit) addressed to Lord Hanuman. It was composed by Goswami Tulsidas in praise of Lord Hanuman.</p>
    <li>
        <p>Chalis = 40, Chalisa = 40 verses; Hanuman Chalisa is a Hymn of 40 verses in praise of Lord Hanuman.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Stories of Tulsidas, Raghavendra Swami describe the compassion and support of Hanuman to those who seek his help or pray to Lord Rama. Tulsidas has written this to inspire spiritual aspirants to become devotees of Lord Rama so that they are blessed and protected by Hanuman, and are spiritually progressing.</p>

    <h2>Story...</h2>
    <p>Wherever you are in India, you are likely to have seen this sticker on a car bumper or screen, on a moped or some other form of transport. The image is also seen on T-Shirts, watch dials, as laptop skins and on other merchandise: It’s Lord Hanuman in a stylised, graphical avatar; but shorn of the deity’s usual humility and devotion. This is an angry Lord Hanuman. We look at the story behind the angry Hanuman and explore why this angry avatar has caught on in such a big way.</p>
